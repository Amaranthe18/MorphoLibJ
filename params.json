{"name":"MorphoLibJ","tagline":"Collection of  mathematical morphology methods and plugins for ImageJ","body":"MorphoLibJ\r\n============\r\n\r\nCollection of mathematical morphology methods and plugins for ImageJ, created at INRA-IJPB Modeling and Digital Imaging lab.\r\n\r\nThe library implements several functionalities that were missing in the ImageJ software, and that were not or only partially covered by other plugins. \r\n\r\n* morphological filtering: erosion & dilation, closing & opening, morphological gradient & laplacian, top-hat...\r\n\r\n* morphological reconstruction, allowing fast detection of regional or extended extrema, removing of borders, or hole filling\r\n\r\n* watershed segmentation + GUI, making it possible to segment 2D/3D images of cell tissues\r\n\r\n* 2D/3D measurements: volume, surface area, inertia ellipse/ellipsoid...\r\n\r\n* binary / label images utilities for removing or keeping largest connected component, perform size opening, fill holes, kill borders...\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n* In ImageJ, download the latest released jar into the _plugins_ folder.\r\n\r\n* In Fiji, you just need to add the IJPB-plugins update site:\r\n\r\n> 1. Select _Help > Update..._ from the Fiji menu to start the updater.\r\n\r\n> 2. Click on _Manage update sites_. This brings up a dialog where you can activate additional update sites.\r\n\r\n> 3. Activate the IJPB-plugins update site and close the dialog. Now you should see an additional jar file for download.\r\n\r\n> 4. Click _Apply changes_ and restart Fiji.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nA more detailed presentation of the plugin for the user is available on the \r\n[ImageJ Wiki](http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:segmentation:morphological_segmentation:start), \r\nas well as on the [Fiji Wiki](http://fiji.sc/Morphological_Segmentation).\r\n\r\nThe main source code directory is [src/main/java/inra/ijpb](http://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ/tree/master/src/main/java/inra/ijpb).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
